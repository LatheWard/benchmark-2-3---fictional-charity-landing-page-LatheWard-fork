      <div class="col-3">
        In 1996, our founder Mike Stokes was homeless, broken, and had one good
        pair of shoes to his name. During this time span of his life, he was
        fortunate enough to get a winning lottery ticket of $300,000, invested
        his money, and ever since has dedicated his life to helping children.

            me. I want to give back to this community that has helped me so
            much."

        In the year 2010, Kicks for Kids was born. With HQ right here in
        Pontotoc, MS, there is so much we have been able to accomplish for the
        community.
